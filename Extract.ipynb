The facts are undisputed. The appellant’s application uploaded \\nfrom the cyber café did mention the date of birth as 08.12.1997 \\nwhile his date of birth as recorded in the educational certificate \\nwas 18.12.1997.

It also had a clause that the candidates \\nhad to fill the correct date of birth, according to their 10th board \\ncertificate. The clause further stated that candidates will fill their \\nname, father’s name, address etc. correctly in the application form. It \\nstates that any discrepancy, if found, while checking the documents, \\nthe candidature of the candidate will stand cancelled. There was \\nalso a clause providing for correction of wrong/erroneously filled \\napplication forms, which stated that the errors can be corrected once \\nby re-depositing the application fee and filling a new application. It \\nalso provided that those filling the application on the last date could \\ncorrect the application till the following day.\\n13. Equally undisputed is the fact that after filling out the application, the \\nappellant cleared the written examination and the Physical Eligibility \\nTest. It was also stated in the counter affidavit that there were 61 \\nunfilled vacancies though it was submitted that it was meant for the \\nGorkha candidates. \\n14.

There, the judgment in \\nAjay Kumar Mishra vs. Union of India & Ors., [2016] SCC OnLine \\nDel 6563, a case very similar to the facts of the present case, was \\nnoted. In Ajai Kumar Mishra (supra), Indira Banerjee, J. (as Her \\nLadyship then was) speaking for the Division Bench of the Delhi \\nHigh Court in para 9 stated as under:-\\n9.

The Court \\naccepted the explanation and condoned the error in the filling up of \\nthe column pertaining to the date of birth. \\n18. The learned counsel for the State drew attention to the verification \\nby the appellant, of the details in a printed form furnished by the \\nselection board. He contended that the appellant signed the form \\nwhich carried the date of birth. First of all, the form was a printed \\nform which reflected the date of birth as given by the appellant and \\nthe appellant signed the printed form on 10.03.2018. We are inclined \\nto accept the explanation of the appellant that since the appellant \\nwas unaware of his own mistake he had mechanically signed the \\nprinted form. It is only later, on 11.06.2018, on the publication of \\nthe result that the appellant realized the error. We do not think that \\nthe appellant could be penalised for this insignificant error which \\nmade no difference to the ultimate result.

In this case, the appellant has participated in the selection process \\nand cleared all the stages successfully. The error in the application \\nis trivial which did not play any part in the selection process. The \\nState was not justified in making a mountain out of this molehill. \\nPerhaps the rarefied atmosphere of the cybercafe, got the better of \\nthe appellant. He omitted to notice the error and even failed to avail \\nthe corrective mechanism offered. In the instant case, we cannot turn \\na Nelson’s eye to the ground realities that existed. In the order dated \\n22.11.2021 in C.A. No. 6983 of 2021 [Prince Jaibir Singh vs. Union \\nof India & Ors.], this Court rightly observed that though technology \\nis a great enabler, there is at the same time, a digital divide. \\n20. In one of the cases cited as a precedent in the counter affidavit, \\nbefore the High Court, Pankaj Paswan vs. State of Bihar Anr., \\n2015 SCC On Line Patna 8739, the State had taken a defence that \\nmany candidates applied in more than one place and hence there \\ncould be deliberate tweaking in the date of birth to take advantage \\nof the selection process in more than one district or region. It is very \\nimportant to notice that there is no such plea taken in the present \\ncase. If any such device or trick had been adopted, the State would \\nhave easily detected the same and placed the same before the Court. \\nThe fact that the same has not been done shows that there was no \\ntrick or device resorted to by the appellant. It is a trivial error which \\nappears to be a genuine and bona fide mistake. It will be unjust to \\npenalise the appellant for the same. \\n21. Learned counsel for the State, in the written submissions, stated that \\nthe instructions clearly stipulated that if two or more candidates obtain \\nthe same marks in the Physical Eligibility Test, their relative rank in \\nthe final merit list could be determined on the basis of their date of \\nbirth. The implication in the submission is that the date of birth is a \\nsignificant aspect. On that basis, he submits that the cancellation \\nought to be upheld. We do not find merit in the submission. The \\noriginal date of birth, as available is 18.12.1997, in the educational \\ncertificates. There is no dispute that the appellant’s date of birth was, \\nin fact, 18.12.1997. In view of that, we do not see the said clause in \\nthe instructions as an impediment for the selection of the appellant.\\n22.

The said \\njudgment is clearly distinguishable. There the issue was about allowing \\nentry of ineligible persons into the selection. While the eligibility \\nprescribed was Teacher’s Training Certificate from a recognized \\ninstitute or intermediate or equivalent from a recognized Board/\\nUniversity with an elective subject in the required language at the \\nmatric level, candidates with B.Ed. degree sought appointment as \\nAssistant Teacher. Negating their claim, this Court held that the \\nB.Ed. qualification cannot be treated as a qualification higher than \\nthe Teacher’s Training Certificate, because the nature of the training \\nimparted for grant of certificate and for grant of degree was totally \\ndifferent. In that context, this Court held that deviating from the rules \\nand allowing entry to ineligible persons would deprive many others \\nwho could have competed for the post. Yogesh Kumar (supra) has \\nno application to the facts of the present case. Equally distinguishable \\nare the judgments of the Delhi High Court in Rohit Kumar and \\nAnother vs. Union of India and Others, 2022 SCC OnLine Del \\n1219 and Pradeep Kumar vs. Union of India and Others, 2022 \\nSCC OnLine Del 239.\\n23. In the case of Rohit Kumar (supra), the undisputed facts, as is \\nclear from para 10 of the judgment, was that the candidate was \\ndeclared unsuccessful on two counts, namely, that the OBC certificate \\nuploaded by the candidate was not as per the format as mentioned \\nin the advertisement and additionally on the ground that the date \\nof issuance of the certificate was wrongly mentioned in the online \\napplication. \\n24. In Pradeep Kumar (supra), the identity proof (Aadhaar Card) was not \\nuploaded and instead the self photograph of the candidate has been \\nuploaded. We find that the said two judgments are distinguishable \\non facts for the reasons set out above. \\n25. On the peculiar facts of this case, considering the background in which \\nthe error occurred, we are inclined to set aside the cancellation. We \\nare not impressed with the finding of the Division Bench that there \\nwas no prayer seeking quashment of the results declared over the \\nweb. A reading of the prayer clause in the writ petition indicates that \\nthe appellant did pray for a mandamus directing the respondents \\nto consider the candidature treating his date of birth as 18.12.1997 \\n', metadata={'source': 'judgement/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'file_path': 'judgement/layout-parser-paper.pdf', 'page': 8, 'total_pages': 10, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.1 (Windows)', 'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240118195014+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240118195014+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''})]"

      "before the High Court, Pankaj Paswan vs. State of Bihar Anr., \n",
      "2015 SCC On Line Patna 8739, the State had taken a defence that \n",
      "many candidates applied in more than one place and hence there \n",
      "could be deliberate tweaking in the date of birth to take advantage \n",
      "of the selection process in more than one district or region. It is very \n",
      "important to notice that there is no such plea taken in the present \n",

      "the instructions clearly stipulated that if two or more candidates obtain \n",
      "the same marks in the Physical Eligibility Test, their relative rank in \n",
      "the final merit list could be determined on the basis of their date of \n",
      "birth. The implication in the submission is that the date of birth is a \n",

      "in fact, 18.12.1997. In view of that, we do not see the said clause in \n",
      "the instructions as an impediment for the selection of the appellant.\n",
